ExceptionControl Class Reference
================================
The ExceptionControl class provides some controls over how 'events' are handled
based on a configurable property ``exception_control_level`` which is used to
determine if an event should trigger an Exception to be raised, a WARNING to
be printed, or nothing based on the severity class of the event in question.
